// SnapshotLength defines the PCAP snapshot length.
//
// If, when capturing, you capture the entire contents of the packet, that
// requires more CPU time to copy the packet to your application, more disk
// and possibly network bandwidth to write the packet data to a file, and more
// disk space to save the packet. If you don't need the entire contents of the
// packet - for example, if you are only interested in the TCP headers of
// packets - you can set the "snapshot length" for the capture to an
// appropriate value. If the snapshot length is set to snaplen, and snaplen is
// less than the size of a packet that is captured, only the first snaplen bytes
// of that packet will be captured and provided as packet data.
// A snapshot length of 65535 should be sufficient, on most if not all networks,
// to capture all the data available from the packet.

// On broadcast LANs such as Ethernet, if the network isn't switched, or if the
// adapter is connected to a "mirror port" on a switch to which all packets
// passing through the switch are sent, a network adapter receives all packets
// on the LAN, including unicast or multicast packets not sent to a network
// address that the network adapter isn't configured to recognize.
// Normally, the adapter will discard those packets; however, many network
// adapters support "promiscuous mode", which is a mode in which all packets,
// even if they are not sent to an address that the adapter recognizes, are
// provided to the host. This is useful for passively capturing traffic between
// two or more other hosts for analysis.
// Note that even if an application does not set promiscuous mode, the adapter
// could well be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.
